Formulaire

Formulaire is a project that demonstrates the use of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles in JavaScript to create a dynamic form. It also utilizes the browser's LocalStorage to persist form data, ensuring that user inputs are saved and can be retrieved even after the browser is closed or refreshed.
Features

    Object-Oriented Design: The form is built using JavaScript classes, promoting modularity and reusability of code.
    LocalStorage Integration: User inputs are automatically saved to LocalStorage, allowing data persistence across sessions.
    Dynamic Form Handling: The form can handle various input types and validates data in real-time, providing immediate feedback to users.

Technologies Used

    HTML: Structures the form elements and layout.
    CSS: Styles the form, ensuring a responsive and user-friendly interface.
    JavaScript: Implements form functionality using OOP and manages data storage with LocalStorage.

Installation

To run the Formulaire project locally:

    Clone the Repository:

    git clone https://github.com/EwennAnsquer/Formulaire.git
    cd Formulaire

    Open the Project:

    Open the index.html file in your preferred web browser to view and interact with the form.

Usage

    Filling Out the Form: Enter data into the form fields. The form will validate inputs in real-time and provide feedback for any incorrect entries.
    Data Persistence: All inputs are saved to LocalStorage automatically. If you close or refresh the browser, the previously entered data will be retained.
    Clearing Data: To clear the form and remove data from LocalStorage, use the reset button provided within the form.
